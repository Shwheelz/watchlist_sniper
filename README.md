Watchlist Sniper
================

Watchlist Sniper was created as a means to beat the rush to sign up for Penn State Watchlist courses.  Simply add basic information to go into eLion, then wait to receive the text and hit submit.  Watchlist Sniper will take care of the rest!  Please follow the instructions below for best results.

Prerequisites:
<ul>
<li>Ruby 1.9.3 or higher</li>
<li>The appropriate Ruby DevKit may need installed on Windows</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
</ul>

How to Run:

To install the gems necessary to run this script, run
```bundle install```

Next, run init.bt to add Chromedriver to you PATH and start the GUI.  Enter your eLion credentials and course number, then hit start when you're ready to sign up for the course.  Alternatively, you can edit WatchlistSniper.rb with your credentials and just run that. This option is faster but less secure.
